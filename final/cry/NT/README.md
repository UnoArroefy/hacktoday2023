# NT

## Desc

```
My professor gave me an assignment but i can't solve it. He said "NT :D".
```

## Bug

```
extra information on RSA    --> recover degree on both equation using its bit size, match the degree on both equation, match the coefficient on variable p or q, elimination and get the factor using GCD  
```

## Solver

```
prepare the possible coefficient before connect to the netcat to reduce the time.
match the degree, coefficient, and eliminations.
GCD.
